-- always use the pager, so that things behave the same every time:
\pset pager always

-- more consistency. I think it's bad to wrap lines in sql output, I'd rather tap the right arrow to get to the next screen:
\setenv PAGER 'less --chop-long-lines'

-- show nulls as _something_ instead of a blank space
-- (you could use a fun emoji like ðŸš« here, if so inclined)
\pset null '[null]'

-- give ourselves a nice lengthy history:
\set HISTSIZE 20000

-- psql's expanded table formatting is weird. let's explicitly disable it. no surprises!
\x off

-- print the duration of queries after they finish. it's always good to know how long things take!
\timing
